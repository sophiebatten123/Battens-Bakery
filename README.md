# Overview

[Batten's Bakery]() is a Bakery Website aimed at enticing customers to book in for its famous afternoon tea. It promotes delicious cakes and scrumptious pasteries with an added lockdown twist at the companies request to allow its customers to bake their favourites whilst in the comfort of their own home. Batten's Bakery caters for many dietery requirements including vegatarian, vegan and gluten free options in all its recipes.

The site itself is fully responsive and deisgned in a simplistic and easy to navigate manner. It has been coded using solely HTML and CSS due to this being my first project and therefore although it has 'form' elements on the website, due to no back-end fuctionality the entered fields will not be sent anywhere.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

![Colour Scheme](assets/images/colourpalette.PNG)

- The sites primary colours are green, cream, black and white. The image above displays the original colour scheme which was chosen for the website. It uses a wide range of pastel shades to create a soft texture to the website; whilst also ensuring that text is clear and readable. 

- The websites main text was written against a white background this was due to the contrast against the green making it stand out to the user on the page. 

- The colour pallete was chosen and matched using [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/).

## Typography 

![Typography]()

- The main font used throughout the whole wesbite was 'Mate SC' with Sans Serif as a fall back font in the rare instance that the font is incorrectly imported onto the site. Alongside this font some hand written text was written to create a more personalised feel to the website whilst also contrasting nicely against the hard edges of 'Mate SC'. Both of these text styles are easy to read and suited the style of the website.

## Imagery

![Imagery]()

- The images on the website were carefuly and deliberately choosen to blend with the colour scheme of the website. The intial large heading image captures the users attention whilst also working in unison with the website. Images on the recipes pages were chosen to entice the user and therefore look delicious!
